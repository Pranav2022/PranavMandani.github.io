                        <p>
                            I developed a robust data analysis tool, leveraging the power of Python's Django framework to facilitate efficient backend data manipulation. The tool features a user-friendly interface designed for intuitive data handling, providing a seamless experience. Users can benefit from a range of features, including punctuation removal, lowercase and uppercase transformations, capitalization of each word, elimination of unwanted whitespaces, and the removal of extra newlines. These capabilities collectively enhance the tool's functionality, making data manipulation and analysis more accessible and user-friendly.
                            also in updation mode adding more features in future work.

                        <h3>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a prevalent sleep disorder, is characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, leading to momentary awakenings. In March 2022, I played a pivotal role in a 4-person team, contributing to the design and implementation of an OSA application. Leveraging Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with machine learning using Random Forest with 95% accuracy and a 30% recall rate, the application empowers users to monitor sleep patterns and identify potential indicators of OSA. Additionally, in a separate initiative with a 3-person team, we successfully developed a SmartCare System, employing similar technologies and machine learning methodologies to analyze sleep patterns and detect signs of OSA, further enhancing our commitment to sleep health.

                        <p>Led a team of 4 selected students, out of 250 interviewed, for an innovative project at TextMover Labs LLC—developing an Intelligent Latex Equation Sequencer. This educational application employs interactive animations to teach mathematical derivations virtually. The system comprises three modules: the first converts Latex equations to SVG images, the second breaks down SVG images using a CNN for element recognition, and the third animates each recognized element. Achieved a 95% accuracy rate with a CNN algorithm for handwritten character identification, and seamlessly integrated advanced animation techniques using Docker, ReactJs, nodeJs, and CNN for an enhanced visual presentation of mathematical derivations.</p>

                            Developed a sophisticated Railway Announcement System using Python, this project streamlines the process of creating voice-based announcements for trains in various languages. The system boasts an intuitive user interface designed for station personnel, enabling easy input and management of announcement content—making it accessible even to non-technical staff. The project's core functionality includes generating automatic announcements for trains, supporting multiple stations seamlessly. With features such as generating city names, train details, and platform numbers in different languages, the system significantly reduces the time and effort required for announcement creation, ensuring efficient communication across railway networks
